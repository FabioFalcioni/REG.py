# REG.py
This repository is a continuation of the development of the Relative Energy Gradient (REG) method implemented in python3.

Please, visit https://github.com/ljduarte/REG.py for the original code.

The manual.pdf contains the information regarding the theory and the code implementation. 

-GUI IMPLEMENTATION:
A simple and basic GUI has been implemented for files and options management. This is contained in the reg_analysis.py and runs with PySimpleGUI package. Keep in mind that this is in early stages.
For now, it works only on full atomic REG analysis (grouping of atoms for bigger systems will be implemented in the future).

Please, report bugs and issues to fabioslefou@gmail.com
